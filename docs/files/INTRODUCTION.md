# NSDlib

NSDlib (Network source detection library) is a comprehensive library designed for detecting sources of propagation in networks. This library offers a variety of algorithms that help researchers and developers analyze and identify the origins of information (epidemic etc.) spread within networks.

## Overview

NSDLib is a complex library designed for easy integration into existing projects. It aims to be a comprehensive repository
of source detection methods, outbreak detection techniques, and propagation graph reconstruction tools. Researchers worldwide are encouraged to contribute and utilize this library,
facilitating the development of new techniques to combat misinformation and improve propagation analysis.
Each  year, new techniques are introduced through scientific papers, often with only pseudo-code descriptions, making it
difficult for researchers to evaluate and compare them with existing methods. NSDlib tries to bridge this gap and enhance researchers to put their implementations here.
